# DataScience
Data Wrangaling:

. Achieved clean dataset by implementing robust data cleaning processes.

. Led the development of visualizations, resulting in clear and impactful data presentations.

. Collaborated with team members to iterate on data models, enhancing visualization accuracy.

. Implemented advanced visualization techniques, which improved data interpretation by 30%.

. Analyzed large datasets to provide insights that supported data-driven decisions.



Employee Turnover Analytics:

.Perform data quality check by checking for missing values if any.

.Balance and then split the data into a test-train split.

.Understand what factors contributed most to employee turnover by EDA.

.Determine whether grouping features together into a single feature helps. Specifically, look at time spent at company and number of projects (which both correlate with tenure, but together can capture a notion of “engagement”).

.Train classification models (SVMs, Decision Trees, Random Forest) using k-folds. And evaluate which model is the best performer.

.Train the best model using all available data in the train set.

.Test the trained model against the test set and output accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score.


ML_(1):

. Perfoming data quality check.

. Balance and then split the data into a test-train split.

. Predicting the sales of TV by linear regission model.


Neural Network Project (Predicting the likelihood that eBay auction is a shilling scheme):

. Achieved high prediction accuracy by implementing and fine-tuning various ML models.

. Led the project from data collection to model deployment, resulting in actionable health insights.

. Collaborated with healthcare professionals to interpret model results, enhancing the practical application of findings.

. Implemented cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, which improved model performance by 20%.

. Analyzed patient data to provide insights that informed healthcare decisions.
